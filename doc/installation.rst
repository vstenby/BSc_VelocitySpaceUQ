============

The MATLAB Toolbox
------------------

The MATLAB Toolbox can be downloaded directly from GitHub via the terminal by executing the following:

.. code-block:: bash

or downloaded from the `GitHub repository. <https://github.com/vstenby/BSc_VelocitySpaceUQ/>`_

mosek
-----

The MATLAB Toolbox works with MATLAB's built-in optimizers, but it can take some time for some of the computations.
Therefore it is suggested that mosek is installed. For how to install mosek, you can find the guide 
`here. <https://docs.mosek.com/9.2/install/installation.html/>`_
